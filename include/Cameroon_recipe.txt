 Here is a recipe for Camembert Gratinee, a delicious vegetarian recipe from Cameroon that uses Gruyere, onions, and olives as core ingredients:

Ingredients:

- 1 wheel of Camembert cheese (about 8 ounces)
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup chopped olives (preferably pitted)
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup Gruyere cheese, grated
- 1/2 cup breadcrumbs
- 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook chopped onions and olives in heavy cream for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions are soft. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. In a small bowl, mix together Gruyere cheese, breadcrumbs, thyme, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.
4. Place the wheel of Camembert in a small baking dish. Pour the onion and olive mixture on top of the cheese, then sprinkle the cheese and breadcrumb mixture over it. Drizzle melted butter over the top.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, until the top is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
6. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Camembert Gratinee goes well with potatoes or bread for dipping, and a fresh fruit salad for dessert. 

For a vegan alternative, you could substitute the Camembert cheese for a vegan camembert style cheese, the heavy cream for plant based cream, and the Gruyere cheese and butter for a plant based cheese and butter alternative. 

Note: This recipe is traditionally from the city of Douala in Cameroon.
