It is a corn and onion pie that is typically made with beef or chicken, but can also be made vegetarian by omitting the meat and using a vegan egg replacement.

    ## Ingredients:
    
    - 2 pounds corn kernels (about 8 cups)
    - 1/2 cup vegetable oil

    - 1/2 cup chopped green bell pepper
    - 1/2 cup chopped black olives
    - 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese

    - 2 teaspoons baking powder
    - 1/2 teaspoon salt
