 Here is a recipe for a Potataouille, a delicious and traditional vegetarian recipe from Auckland, New Zealand that uses potatoes, onions, and olives:

Ingredients:

- 2 pounds potatoes, unpeeled and chopped into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1 cup finely chopped onion
- 1/2 cup chopped pitted green olives
- 1/2 cup chopped pitted black olives
- 1/2 cup grated Gruyere cheese
- 1/2 cup vegetable stock or water
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1/4 cup of the olive oil. Roast in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or until tender.

3. In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onions in the remaining olive oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the roasted potatoes, both kinds of olives, cheese, stock or water, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the potatoes are coated in the sauce.

4. Serve the Potataouille hot, as a side dish or a main course with a green salad.

As for an additional desert, you could make a pineapple cake with maraschino cherries, using a recipe from Wellington, New Zealand. 

For a vegan alternative, you could substitute the Gruyere cheese for a plant-based cheese alternative and the chicken stock for a vegetable stock.
