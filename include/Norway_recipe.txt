 Here is a delicious vegetarian recipe from Norway that uses potatoes, onions, and olives as main ingredients:

Norway'sudenfare Gisada

This dish is commonly found in the countryside of Norway. The recipe is simple, and the result is a warm and satisfying meal. Some ingredients can be substituted with vegan alternatives, and for an additional desert option you can try æbleskiver, a delicious traditional Danish treat that is often served with powdered sugar and jam. 

Ingredients:

1 lb potatoes (approximately 2-3 medium potatoes)
1/2 cup coarsely grated Gruyere cheese
1/2 cup milk
2 tbsp olive oil
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup pitted black olives, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup fresh pineapple, coarsely chopped (optional)
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper

Instructions:

1. Peel and cube the potatoes. Place them in a medium-sized saucepan, and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the potatoes until they are just tender (about 15 minutes).
2. Meanwhile, in a separate pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it is tender and translucent (about 5 minutes).
3. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).
4. Drain the potatoes, then return them to the saucepan. Add the sautéed onion, chopped olives, Gruyere cheese, milk, salt, and pepper. Stir gently until well combined.
5. Transfer the mixture to a greased baking dish. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the potatoes are cooked through.
6. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh pineapple (optional).

If you prefer a vegan version of this dish, you can substitute the Gruyere cheese with a vegan cheese alternative and the milk with any plant-based milk, such as almond or oat milk. You can also omit the pineapple garnish or substitute it with a fresh or dried fruit of your choice.
